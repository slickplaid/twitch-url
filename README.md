# Twitch URL
A small node.js script to get the .m3u8 links for twitch.tv

Particularly useful for viewing the streams via a preferred video player, rather than the twitch.tv website.

***

## Install and Usage

1. Install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/), if you don't have it already.
2. Fire up __Terminal__ or __Command Prompt (CMD)__.
3. Navigate to where you have downloaded the script.
4. Type in `npm install` and wait for the installation to finish.
5. Type in `node twitch.js channelName`. Where the `channelName` is the name of the Twitch channel you want to watch. For example: `node twitch.js riotgames`.
6. You will be presented with a list of stream URLs. Copy the link for the appropriate quality and enjoy your stream!

## Coming Soon

* An nw.js wrapper alongside a GUI, to make it easier to use.
* Better code structure.


# Issues and Requests

Although the script is very minimalistic, feature requests and issue reports are very welcome!
